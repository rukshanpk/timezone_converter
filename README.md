# timezone_converter
This is a utility program written to convert the inserted date and time from local time zone to the targeted time zone.
This code was taken from https://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2009/05/converting-time-zones-datetime-objects-python/. 
Thanks must be gone to the original programmer.
